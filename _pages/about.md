I am a forth year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Warwick supervised by [Prof. Theo Damoulas](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/damoulas/) and [Dr. Ramanujan Sridharan](https://msramanujan.weebly.com/). I am an active member of the [Warwick Machine Learning Group](https://wmlg.io/).

I study algorithms for robust decision making under Bayesian machine learning models. Specifically, my research focuses on Bayesian formulations of distributionally robust optimisation (DRO) with applications to routing problems. My strength lies in combining theoretical analysis with practical implementation to address real-world challenges.

From Oct 2022 - Mar 2023 I was an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon, supervised by [Dr. Phillip Loick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipp-loick-9333b6173/?originalSubdomain=lu), where I developed multi-objective optimisation algorithms for network planning that minimise cost whilst maximising delivery speed to customers.

Prior to starting my PhD, I was a research assistant working at The Alan Turing Institute (2019-2020) and the University of Warwick (2018-2019). Projects I was working on include the London Air Quality Project and Project Odysseus. From 2015-2018, I completed my BSc in Computer Science at the University of Warwick.
